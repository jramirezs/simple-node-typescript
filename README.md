# simple-node-typescript

Simple Node + Typescript starter I use mostly as playground for creating and testing small programs.

Target Node is **v18**.

## Getting started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Main commands

```bash
# Start server from build (production-like)
npm start

# Start project with nodemon with hot-reloading
npm run dev

# Creates compiled dist
npm run build

# Runs linter
npm run lint
```
